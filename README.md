omise-dotnet
============

Omise.Net is a .Net library written in C# provides the wrapper functions for Omise payment API calls.

Requirements
============
The library works with .Net framework 2.0, 3.5, 4.0 or 4.5.

Installation
============
To use the library, simply add a reference to Omise.Net.dll and you are ready to go. The library also available on nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/Omise.Net/.

Getting started
===============

The core of the library is the Client which contains all services to call the APIs.To initialize the client, you need to have the api secret key.

```c#
  var client = new Omise.Client(YOUR_SECRET_KEY, [YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY]); 
  //public key is optional which is required only if you want to create a token on the server side
```

or to specify the api version

```c#
var client = new Omise.Client(YOUR_SECRET_KEY, [YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY])
{
    ApiVersion = "2014-07-27"
}; 
  //public key is optional which is required only if you want to create a token on the server side
```

Creating a token
----------------

To create a token use [Omise.js](https://docs.omise.co/omise-js/) Javascript library.

**Credit Card data should never go through your servers. That means, do not send the credit card data to Omise from your servers directly, do it from the user browser.**

The token creation method in the library should only be used either with fake data in test mode, e.g.: quickly creating some test data or for testing our API from a terminal. You can send card data from the server only if you have a valid PCI-DSS license.

Creating a token with Omise.js
------------------------------

The [Omise.js](https://github.com/omise/omise.js) library runs on the user browser and sends card directly from the browser to our servers in HTTPS, as well collecting browser information in order to detect fraud. Omise will return a Token for the given card in which you must pass to your server to complete the charge. 
Some examples and source code can be found here: [github.com/omise/omise.js](https://github.com/omise/omise.js)

Simplify the integration with Card.js
-------------------------------------

You can also use [Omise Card.js](https://docs.omise.co/card-js/), which creates a credit card payment html form for getting a card token from Omise, which you can use to make a charge with `omise-dotnet`.

For both methods, the client will directly send the card information to Omise gateway, your servers don't have to deal with credit card information to prevent any risk.

Please read more about it here [Security Best Practices](https://docs.omise.co/security-best-practices/) and  [Collecting Card Information](https://docs.omise.co/collecting-card-information/)

Creating a charge
-----------------

 ```c#
var chargeInfo = new ChargeCreateInfo ();
chargeInfo.Amount = 10000; //Create a charge with amount 100 THB, here we are passing with the smallest currency unit which is 10000 satangs
chargeInfo.Currency = "THB";
chargeInfo.Description = "Test charge";
chargeInfo.Capture = true; //TRUE means auto capture the charge, FALSE means authorize only. Default is FALSE
chargeInfo.CardId = token; //Token generated with Omise.js or Card.js

var charge = client.ChargeService.CreateCharge(chargeInfo);
 ```

Determine if charge success
---------------------------

In the charge result there is a bool property named 'Captured' which tells us that the money has been charged by the acquirer bank if the value is ```TRUE```, 
otherwise there will be another factors making the charge not being captured. For more information, visit https://docs.omise.co/api/charges/

Creating a customer
-------------------
```c#
var customer = new CustomerInfo();
customer.Email = "test@localhost";
customer.Description = "My test customer";

var customerResult = client.CustomerService.CreateCustomer(customer);
``` 

With the customerResult, you can get access to the customer properties such Id, Email, Description and so on.

Transfer money to bank account
------------------------------
```c#
var result = client.TransferService.CreateTransfer(10000);
//transfer amount is in smallest unit of the currency, for THB the smallest unit is SATANG so here we are transfering 100 THB
```

The transfer will be made to default RECIPIENT which in TEST mode it has been automatically created once you signup to Omise.
However, you have to complete the registration form in order to get LIVE account (with default LIVE recipient) activated. 

Creating a recipient
--------------------
A transfer can also be made to a third-party recipient. The example below demonstrates how to create a recipient.

```c#
var recipientInfo = new RecipientCreateInfo();
recipientInfo.Name = "Test recipient 1";
recipientInfo.Email = "test1@localhost";
recipientInfo.RecipientType = RecipientType.Corporation;
recipientInfo.BankAccount = new BankAccountInfo()
{
Brand = "test",
Number = "1234567890",
Name = "test bank account"
};

var recipient = client.RecipientService.CreateRecipient(recipientInfo);
```

Then to transfer to this recipient

```c#
 var result = client.TransferService.CreateTransfer(10000, recipient.Id);
```

Support banks
